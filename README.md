# Bayt al-Hikmah

Bayt al-Hikmah is a modern platform for managing and engaging with knowledge sources across formatsâ€”including books, academic papers, podcasts, videos, and articles. Its core purpose is to help users collect, organize, annotate, and track their engagement with these sources, while optionally contributing to a shared public knowledge space.

## Features

- **Structured knowledge source tracking:** Track metadata like title, author, tags, type, and progress.
- **Notes and annotations:** Create private and public notes linked to specific sources, pages, or timestamps.
- **Reading and knowledge timeline:** Visualize your engagement over time.
- **Lists and collections:** Organize sources by theme or intent.
- **Tags, topics, and taxonomies:** Contextualize your knowledge with flexible organization.
- **Ratings and reviews:** Evaluate and reflect on sources.
- **User profiles:** Showcase your reading history, contributions, and knowledge areas.
